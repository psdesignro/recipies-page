## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I didn't use CSS grid for a while, but I decided to use it over table, because as far as I know, table is a mess on small devices

I also unse one intermediate media query, that would work  for tablets.

### Continued development

I got the Frontend Mentor Pro  subscription and hope to dive more into interesting challenges
